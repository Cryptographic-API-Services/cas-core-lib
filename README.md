# eas-core-lib
This is our core library which is an FFI layer that takes advantage of Rust's thread safe nature to provide an abstraction layer to higher level languages to run industry standard crytographic operations sequentially, on threads, and the thread pool.  

## Consuming Library Documentation
We utilize some smart people's existing work and we believe their documentation should be reviewed when possible.
